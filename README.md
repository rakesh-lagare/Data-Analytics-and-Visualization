# Lab - Fraunhofer- FIT - European Trade Visualization and Analysis

It involves Overview of EU trade with rest of the world in terms of different transport modes (Rail, Road , Waterways , Airways).  
Impact of energy consumption and CO2 emission on GDP and also predictive analysis of CO2 emission.

UI - Shiny Dashboard
Predictions - Arima predictions were used to answer the framed questions.   
Algorithms - Logistic Regression, SVM and Anova.  

Multiple regression methods to identify the relationship between the variables.  
Linear Regression  
Multiple Regression  
Poisson Regression  
Loess – Smoothening  
Anova – One Way Analysis of variance – Signiface between variables  

Forecasting models :  CO2 emission forecasting for 2030  
Arima - autoregressive integrated moving average  
ETS - The most general and flexible version. Models error, trend and seasonal elements together.  
Tbats - TBATS model allows for dynamic seasonality whereas ARIMA approach is that the seasonality is forced to be periodic
Holtwinters - Computes Holt-Winters Filtering of a given time series.   
Time Series - Test and Train data  
Theta - The theta method of Assimakopoulos and Nikolopoulos (2000) is equivalent to simple exponential smoothing with drift.  
Exponential Smothening – An off shoot of the standard moving average technique.  
Random walk - A random walk is different from a list of random numbers because the next value in the sequence is a modification of the previous value in the sequence  
Structs -  Structural Time Series . Fit a structural model for a time series by maximum likelihood
